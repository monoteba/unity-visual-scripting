# Visual Scripting Graphs

### A collection of relatively small Visual Scripting graph examples for use with Unity 2021 and later.[^1]

---

The examples assume that you have a basic knowledge of how to create and edit Script Graphs in Unity's Visual Scripting. If you have never used Visual Scripting in Unity, I recommend that you find some introduction video.

The examples are not meant as a step-by-step guide, but rather simple graphs for you to study and learn from. I will provide necessary information where needed, like which components that are added to game objects, but not explain every node I use in detail.

[^1]: Some of the graphs may be very similar to the Bolt flows in Unity 2020 and earlier, though differences do exist in naming.
